This version of jquery was produced using a Grunt custom build on the jQuery repository, as described in https://github.com/jquery/jquery

The Grunt command used was

grunt custom:-ajax,-deprecated,-effects,-wrap

(tried adding deferred to this list, but it was used by Bootstrap)

The full list of modules from the "examples" section of the jQuery webpage is
ajax: don't think any Ajax calls are made, so exclude
css: CSS methods are used
deprecated: don't think any deprecated methods are used , so exclude
dimensions: width and height methods are used
effects: Don't think any animate effects are used, so exclude
event: presume events are used, although haven't checked closely
offset: think offset might be used, although haven't checked
wrap: wrap methods aren't used, so exclude
core/ready: ready is used
deferred: deferred is used by Bootstrap
exports/global: the global jQuery variable is used
exports/amd: think this is may be used
