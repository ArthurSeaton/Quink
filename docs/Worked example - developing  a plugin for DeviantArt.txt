Developing  a plugin for deviantArt muro
----------------------------------------

1) Put the code in the Quink plugins folder and launch it manually in its own html page.

Since the plugin will be used inside an iframe, a good first step is to make sure it runs at all.

deviantArt’s documentation says that it’s expected to be used by placing the sandbox page inside an iframe  (https://github.com/deviantART/embedded-deviantART-muro/wiki/How-It-Works), so put the deviantArt code files in Quink and test that the sandbox page runs in isolation.

Outcome: created quink/plugins/deviantart folder containing code. deviantart_muro_sandbox.html ran successfully.
